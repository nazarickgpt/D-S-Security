# Ndumiso Praysworth Zama  
Building Digital Experiences • AI Research Enthusiast • Self-Taught Web & App Creator  

## About Me  
I’m Ndumiso, based in Durban, South Africa. Currently working at Maxhosa Africa (Oceans Mall) as a Sales Assistant, I’ve led teams, managed operations, and always kept one eye on technology. Over time I taught myself to build websites, apps, and started exploring how artificial intelligence systems work. My journey goes beyond retail: I want to design systems where humans and machines collaborate meaningfully.  

My background includes roles as Assistant Manager at All Good Things (2021-2024), Floor Supervisor at Vodacom (2019-2021), and Supervisor at GCO Cellular (2016-2018). I hold a Project Management Certificate (Great Learning Academy) and an NCV Level 3 Certificate in Electrical Engineering (Elangeni TVET). My interests include AI & tech research, coding, writing, and system design.
